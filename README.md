# StoryBook
StoryBook is an app where people can share stories from their lives publically or privately! 

I am following a Traversy Media [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBvmnHTQIPY&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) to practice MVC architecure and Google OAuth.

Challenges:
- Having an issue with the logout functionailty
    - When I add the ensureAuth and ensureGuest middleware to index.js, it does not let the user logout.
- A lot of features of certain modules were deprecated, so I went to the documentation and had to update the code with the current way to do it. It was good practice to go through the documentation and updating an existing codebase.
